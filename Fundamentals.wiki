    *Asymptomatic Analysis For Performance*
    
    * Characterize *time completxity* of method 
      - Time for a method to complete
      - Calculate time as function t(n) relating the number of steps given 
        aggregate size, n
    * Characterize *space complexity* of method 
      - Amount of computer storage required
      - Detarmine required space s(n) in similar fashion

    *Data Structure Cost Model*
    
    * From data structure implementation, determine total number of steps based 
      on n 
      - Sequential, deterministic computing platform
    * Assume a *constant cost* to every operation 
      - Enables using t(n) to estimate execution time
  
    *Asymptotic Growth*
    
    * Evaluate t(n) as problem size n doubles 
      - The true measure for understanding performance
      - Goal to determine *order of growth* or O(f(n))
      - A formal treatment of O(f(n)) can be found in textbooks

    *Asymptotic Space Complexity*
    
    * How much extra storage is required 
      - A secondary concern that cannot be ignored
    * Sample Problem 
      - Determine if `list` contains duplicate values
      - Different solutions based on storage
