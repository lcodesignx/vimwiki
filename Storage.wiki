*Boot partition and file system procedure:*

    `parted /dev/sdb`
    `print` : show current partition table
    `mklabel` : 
        * msdos: MBR
        * gpt: GPT
    `mkpart <partition-type> name <fs-type> start end` :
        * partition-type: applies to MBR only and sets primary, logical, and extended partition
        * name: arbitrary name, required for GPT
        * fs-type: does not modify the filesystem, but sets some irrelevant files system dependent
          metadata
          
    *Example:*
        
        `mkpart primary 1024MiB 2048MiB`
        `udevadm settle`
        
*File Systems*
*Commands:*
    
    `mkfs.xfs`
    `mkfs.ext4`
    
*Understanding fstab*

    * `/etc/fstab` : main configuration file to persistently mount partitions. content is used to 
                   generate systemd mounts by the `systemd-fstab-generator` utility. to update
                   systemd, make sure to use `systemctl daemon-reload` after editing `/etc/fstab`
                   
*Persistent Device Naming*

    * UUID : automatically generated fore each device that contains a file system or anything similar
    * Label : while creating the file system, the option -L can be used to set an arbitrary name that
              can be used to mount the file system
    * `/dev/disk` : location where unique device names are created

*Command:*

    `blkid`
    `tune2fs --help`
    `tune2fs -L articles /dev/sdb1`
    `xfs_admin --help`
    
*Fstab entry example:*

    `LABEL=articles     /articles   ext4    defaults    0 0`
