== Managing Ansible Configuration Files ==

    *Managing ansible.cfg*
    
    * The ansible.cfg file is considered in order of precedence:
        * `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg` is the default
        * `~/.ansible.cfg` if exists will overwrite the default
        * `./ansible.cfg` is the configuration file in ther current Ansible project directory and it will always have 
          precedence if it exists
    * Alternatively, if a variable ANSIBLE_CONFIG exists to refer to a specific config file, this will always have 
      precedence
    * Use `ansible --version` to find which configuration file currently is used

== Lab: Setting up an Ansible Managed Environment ==

    * Finalize setting up the Ansible managed environment and ensure your setup meets the following 
      requirements:
      * User Ansible is used for all management tasks on managed hosts
      * Inventory is set up
      * Ansible.cfg is configured for sudo privilege escalation
      * SSH key-based login has been configured
