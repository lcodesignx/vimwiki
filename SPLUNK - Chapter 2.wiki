== What Data Looks Like in Splunk - Events ==

    *Event*
    
    * A single piece of data in Splunk software is similar to a record in a log file or other data input
    * When data is indexed, it is divided into individual events
    * Each event is given a timestamp, host, source, and sourcetype
    * Often, a single event corresponds to a single line in your inputs, but some inputs 
      (for example, XML or JSON formatted logs) have multiline events, and some inputs have multiple events 
      on a single line
    * When you run a successful search, you get back events
    * Similar events can be categorized together with event types

== Getting Data Out of Splunk - Search ==

    *Search*
    
    * Is the primary way users navigate data in SPluk Enterprise
    * Can wirte a search to retrieve events from an index, use statistical commands to calculate metrics and 
      generate reports, search for specific conditions within a rolling time range window, identify patterns 
      in your data, predict future trends, and so on
    * You can save searches as reports and use them to power dashboard panels
