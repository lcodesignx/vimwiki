== Understanding automount ==

In `/etc/auto.master` you'll identify the directory that automount should manage, and the file that is used for additional mount information.
Entry example:
    `/fs  /etc/auto.fs`

In /etc/auto.fs you'll identify hte subdirectory on which to mount and what to mount exactly.
Entry example:
    `software   -rw     nfsserver:/share/software`
    `docs      -rw     nfsserver:/share/docs`

Ensure the autofs service is started and enabled

    `systemctl enable --now autofs`

Full Example

    `showmount -e nfsserver`
    `yum install autofs`
    `systemctl enable --now autofs`
    `vim /etc/auto.master`
   ` vim /etc/auto.fs`
    `systemctl restart autofs`

Configue automount for home directories
    Create NFS share:
        `vim /etc/exports`
        `/home/ldap     *(rw)`
    Client configuration:
        `showmount -e nfsserver`
        `vim /etc/auto.master`
            `/home/ldap     /etc/auto.ldap`
        `vim /etc/auto.ldap`
            `*  -rw     nfsserver:/home/ldap/&`
        `systemctl restart autofs`
