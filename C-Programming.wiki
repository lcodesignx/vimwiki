=== Storage Classes ===
    * *auto* : default storage class
        `{` 
            `int mount;`
            `auto int month;`
        `}`
    * *register* : define local variables that should be stored in a register instead of RAM
        `{`
            `register int miles;`
        `}`
    * *static* : instructs the compiler to keep a local variable in existence during the life time 
               of the program instead of creating and destroying it each time it comes into and 
               goes out of scope
    * *extern* : used to give reference of a global variable that is visible to ALL the program 
               files. The extern modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files 
               sharing the same global variables or functions.
