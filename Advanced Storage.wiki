== Creating Physical Volumes ==

*Creating a physical volume:*

    * Open root shell and type `parted /dev/sdc`.
    * Type `print`. This will show the current partition table layout. There should be none at this point.
    * Type `mklabel msdos`to set the MBR-compatible partition type. It could also be `mklabel gpt` for gpt partition.
    * Type `mkpart` to start the procedure to create a partition, and enter `primary` when asked for the partition type.
    * Type `xfs` to specify that the XFS file system should be used. When asked for the start position of the partition of the partition, type `1MiB`,
      and when asked for the end, enter `1GiB`.
    * Type `set 1 lvm on` to enable the LVM partition type on the partition.
    * Now that the partition with the correct partition type has been created, type `quit` to close the `parted` interface.

== LVM Creation Procedure Overview ==

    * Create partition on devices (gdisk, parted, fdisk)
    * Use `pvcreate /dev/sdb1` to create the physical volume
    * Create the volume group: 
      `vgcreate vgdata /dev/sdb1`
    * Create the logical group: 
      `lvcreate -n lvdata -L 1G vgdata`
    * Create a file system: 
      `mkfs.ext4 /dev/vgdata/lvdata`
      
== Resizing Logical Volumes ==

    * Use `vgs` to verify availability in the volume group
    * If required, use `vgextend` to add one or more PVS to the VG
    * Use `lvextend -r -L +1G` to grow the LVM logical volume, including the file system
    * Examples:
        `vgextend vgdata /dev/sdc`
        `lvextend -r -L +1020M /dev/vgdata/lvdata`
