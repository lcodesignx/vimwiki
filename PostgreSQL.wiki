== PostgreSQL Audit Commands ==
*List all functions that have security definer option:*
    `SELECT nspname, proname, proargtypes, prosecdef, rolname, proconfig`
    `FROM pg_proc p`
    `JOIN pg_namespace n`
    `ON p.pronamespace = n.oid`
    `JOIN pg_authid a`
    `ON a.oid = p.proowner`
    `WHERE prosecdef OR NOT proconfig IS NULL;`
    
== Database names and sizes ==
* Bitbucket: 339MB PostgreSQL
* Bamboo: 347MB postgres

== Database backups ==
*Backup:*
    `pg_dump -U postgres <dbname> > dbname.sql`
    `gzip dbname.sql`
*Restore:*
    `psql -U username -d dbname < dbname.sql`
    or
    `pg_restore -U username -d dbname -1 dbname.sql`
    
== PostgreSQL master-replica failover ==

*Basic master configuration:*

    `wal_level = logicatl or Hot_Standby`
    `max_wal_senders = 4`
    `max_replication_slots = 4`
    
*Basic replica configuration:*

    `wal_level = logicatl or Hot_Standby`
    `max_wal_senders = 4`
    `max_replication_slots = 4`
    `hot_standby = on`
    `hot_standby_feedback = on`
    
*Failover commands:*

    `./pg_ctl promote -D /var/lib/pgsql/data`
    
*Note:*
Once the command is executed, it verifies any files available in the pg_wal folder, replays them, and then starts as a master node.
It does not try to connect to the (old) master server, and hence the promotion is very fast. 
If you are doing failover manually, then there is no requirement for a trigger file and you can run it in the terminal itself.
Another note of caution: once the old master node comes back online, we have to ensure that it does not start acting as a master again so that no data loss occurs. 
This can easily be controlled by either taking it off the network or ensuring that the IP visible to the applications is also moved over to the replicas.
