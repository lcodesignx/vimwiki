    * How to collect core dump file of a program on RHEL6 and above
    * How to report an application crash in RHEL6 and above
    * How to configure abrt to automatically generate an application core
    
    *Resolution*
    
    Red Hat Enterprise Linux 6/7/8 has a service called abrt, which automatically 
    collects the core dump files on the server and stores them inside the /var/spool/abrt.

    * Ensure that the system is set up to generate application cores by removing the core limits:

        `ulimit -c unlimited`

    * Make sure abrt and abrt-addon-ccpp is installed

        `yum install abrt abrt-addon-ccpp abrt-tui`
    
    * Ensure the ccpp hooks are installed:

        `abrt-install-ccpp-hook install`
        `abrt-install-ccpp-hook is-installed; echo $?;`
    
    * The second command should return 0 (hooks installed)

    * Ensure that this service is up and the ccpp hook to capture core dumps is enabled:

        `service abrtd start`
        `service abrt-ccpp start`
    
    *for RHEL 7 and 8*

        `systemctl start abrtd.service`
        `systemctl start abrt-ccpp.service`
        
    *for RHEL 7/8*

    * To look for core dumps using the GUI, run the command:

        `abrt-gui`

    * To get a list of crashes on the command line, issue the following command:

        `abrt-cli list`
    
    * To generate a report of a specific crash:

        `abrt-cli report DUMPDIR`
    
    * Choose the RHTSupport option to reports crashes into the Red Hat Technical Support system.
      Alternatively, you may use the abrt-cli command to get detailed information about particular crash:

        `abrt-cli info DUMPDIR`
    
    * Locate the coredump file path, and provide the entire directory to the Red Hat Support representative.
