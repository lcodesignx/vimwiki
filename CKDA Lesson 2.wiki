*The Role of the Kubernetes API*:

    * An Application Programmers Ineterface (API) is the interface between a client and a server
    * An API is used to standarize how to access items provided by the server
    * The Kubernetes API defines objects in a Kubernetes environment
    * Any command that is used ina Kubernetes environment, is working in some way with the API
    * Also, all that can be done in Kubernetes, can be explained by exploring API features

*Working with Kubernetes*:

    * The `kubectl` command line utility provides convenient administrator access, allowing you 
      to run many tasks against the cluster
    * Direct API access using commands, such as `curl`, allows developers to address the cluster 
      using API calls from custom scripts
    * The Kubernetes Dashboard can be installed to run on the Kubernetes master node
