== Understanding Modules for Managing Processes and Tasks ==

    *Modules for Managing Processes and Tasks*
    
    * `cron`: uses cron to schedule a job
    * `at`: uses at to run a future job
    * `file`: because some tasks simpoly don't have a specific Ansible module
    * `service`: manages services
    * `service_facts`: uses information about services as facts
    * `systemd`: manages systemd services

    *Understanding the cron Module*
    
    * The `cron` module has a `name` option, which is useful to uniquely identify entries in crontab
    * Notice that this option has no meaning for cron, but it helps Ansible in managing crontab entries

== Lab: Managing Process and Tasks ==

    * Set the default boot state of the file servers to multi-user.target
    * Reboot your server after doing so
    * Configure your playbook such that it will show the message "successfully rebooted" once it is available again
