== Setting Up an AWS Environment ==

    * Create a new VPC dedicated to this training with external access
    * Deploy an Ubuntu 18.04 VM with at least 2 CPU cores, 4GB of RAM, and sufficient storage for Splunk 
      to run and collect data (around 5GB is fine for the lab examples)
    * [[Create]] a security group allowing external access to your instance that we used to generate data

== Splunk Installation ==

    * Docker compose file at fedora:/home/lupera1/code/docker-projects/splunk/src
