== Using Modules to Manipulate Files ==

    *Common File Modules*
    
    * `lineinfile`: ensures that a line is in a file, useful for changing a 
      single line in a file
    * `blockinfile`: manupulates multi-line blocks of text in files
    * `copy`: copies a file from a local or remote machine to a location on a 
      managed host
    * `fetch`: used to fetch a file from a remote machine and store it on the 
      management node
    * `file`: sets attributes to files, and can also create and remove files, 
      symbolic links and more

== Managing SELinux File Context ==

    * `file`: sets attributes to files, including SELinux context, and can also 
      create and remove files, symbolic links and more
    * `sefcontext`: manages SELinux file context in the SELinux Policy (but not 
      on files)
    * Notice that file sets SELinux context directly on the file (like the 
      `chcon` command), and not in the policy
