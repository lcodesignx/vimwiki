== Moving bamboo data to a different database ==

*If database systems are:*

    * the same (for example, moving from PostgreSQL to another PostgreSQL) OR
    * compatible (for example, you are moving from SQL Server 2005 to SQL Server 2008)

*Data can be moved manually. To migrate data:*

    1. Stop the bamboo instance that is using the source database.
    2. Manually transfer the data.
    3. Go to <bamboo-home> and open the bamboo.cfg.xml file.
    4. Provide the properties of the new database.
    5. Start the bamboo instance.
