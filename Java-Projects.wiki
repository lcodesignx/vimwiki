*Transaction Requirements*

Must have:
    * transaction ID
    * customer data
    * vehicle data
    * transaction price
    * transaction start date (when it will take effect)
    * transaction activation date (when transaction moved from draft to active)

Questions:
    * How to tag transaction as draft or active.
    * Mechanism to change from draft to active.
    * How to update price if data is transaction data is changed, (i.e. when vehicle data changes)
    * Transaction vehicle data and start date can only change if transaction is still in draft mode. How do we implement that?

*Manager Class:*

* add vehicle by passing all parameters or from local file.
    * vin number duplication

* stores transactions to file

* edit transaction
    * vehicle data
    * start date
    * update price

* performs validation for all transaction data:
    * transaction id duplication
    * start date is not in the past
    * transaction cannot be activated if it is past transaction start date. (date comparison)
    * no additional dates can be made to an activated transaction
