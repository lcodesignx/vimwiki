*Reading from a file*

    `with open('filename') as file_object:`
        `contents = file_object.read()`
        `print(content)`
    
Read() returns an empty string when it reaches the end of the file. To remove the extra blank line use the following:
    
    `print(contents.rstrip())`
    
*Reading line by line*

    `filename = 'pi_digits.txt'`
    
    `with open(filename) as file_object:`
        `for line in file_object:`
        `print(line.strip())`
        
*Making a list of lines from a file*
When you use with, the file object returned by open() is only available inside the with block that
contains it. If you want to retain access to a file's contents outsied the with block, you can store
the file's lines in a list inside the block and then work with that list.

    `filename = 'pi_digits.txt'`
    
    `with open(filename) as file_object:`
        `lines = file_object.readlines()`
        
    `for line in lines:`
        `print(line.strip())`
        
*Working with a file's contents*

    `filename = 'pi_digits.txt'`
    
    `with open(filename) as file_object:`
        `lines = file_object.readlines()`
        
    `pi_string = ''`
    `for line in lines:`
        `pi_string += line.rstrip()`
        
    `print(pi_string)`
    `print(len(pi_string))`
