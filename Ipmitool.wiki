== View Component Information with IPMItool ==

You can view information about system hardware components. The software refers to these components as field-replaceable unit (FRU) devices.

To read the FRU inventory information on these servers, you must first have the FRU ROMs programmed. After programming is done,
you can see a full list of the available FRU data by using the fru print command, as shown in the following example 
(only two FRU devices are shown in the example, but all devices would be shown).

   `ipmitool -I lanplus -H <IPADDR> -U root -a fru print` 
   
* List iDrac users:
    * `ipmitool user list 1`
 
* Change root user password:
    * `ipmitool user set password <ID>`
