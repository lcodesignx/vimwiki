== Introduction to Puppet Manifests ==

    *Configuration*
    
    * Usint the puppet config command we can view and set configuration parameters including 
      the path to the manifest. If the manifest is a directory then each manifest is processed
      in alphanumeric order.
    
        `puppet config print`
        `puppet config print config`
        `puppet config print manifest --section master --environment production`
        `puppet config set environment dev --section=agent`
        `puppet config print runinterval`
        
== Manifest Files ==
    
    * The puppet agent can apply local manifests by specifying the path. If the path is a directory 
      all manifests are processed. If the agent connects to the server the agent the manifests are 
      located by the settings of the server.
